#4.Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year.

# Define the principal amount
principal_amount = 200  

# Define the rate of interest
rate_of_interest = 5  

# Define the time period
time_period = 5  

# Calculate Simple Interest using the formula
simple_interest = (principal_amount * rate_of_interest * time_period) / 100

# Print the result
print("The Simple Interest is Rs.", simple_interest)
